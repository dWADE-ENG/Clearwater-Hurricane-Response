Clearwater Address Geocoding and Mapping
This Jupyter Notebook project automates the geocoding of addresses in an Excel file by generating latitude and longitude coordinates using the geopy library. The resulting data, enriched with geolocation information, is then saved to a new Excel file. This project is useful for location-based data analysis, mapping, and field inspection planning.
